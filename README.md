# Hackathon Practice Project
Welcome to the Hackathon Practice Project! This is a simple project designed to help you warm up your coding skills, collaborate with teammates, and experiment with ideas before diving into a hackathon. Whether you're building a web app, a script, or a creative solution, this project provides a lightweight starting point.
Project Overview
This project is a ["task manager web app", "CLI tool for generating memes", "weather forecast API scraper"]. It’s built to be simple yet extensible.

## Goals
- Practice coding in a time-constrained environment.
- Experiment with teamwork and version control (e.g., Git).
- Build something functional that can be showcased in a short demo.

## Features
- [Feature 1: e.g., "Add tasks with deadlines"]
- [Feature 2: e.g., "Display tasks in a clean UI"]
- [Feature 3: e.g., "Export tasks to a text file"]

## Tech Stack
- Language: [Python, JavaScript, HTML.]
- Framework/Library: [FastAPI, Boostrap]
- Tools: [Git, pip]
- Other: [e.g., APIs used, if any]

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- [Tool 1: "FastAPI installed"]
- [Tool 2: "Python 3.8+ installed"]
- [Tool 3: "Git installed"]

### Installation
- Clone the repository:
    ```bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hackathon-practice-project.git
    cd hackathon-practice-project
    ```
- Install dependencies:
    ```bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- Run the project:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
## Usage
- Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or adjust based on your setup).
- Follow the on-screen instructions to [e.g., "add a task", "generate output", etc.].

## Contributing
- This is a practice project, so feel free to fork it, tweak it, or break it! If you’re working in a team:
    - Create a new branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-idea
    ```
    - Commit your changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add my cool feature"
    ```
    - Push and create a pull request:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-idea
    ```
## Hackathon Tips
- Plan: Spend 10 minutes sketching your idea before coding.
- Divide: Split tasks among team members (e.g., frontend, backend, design).
- Test: Leave time to test and debug—perfect isn’t the goal, functional is!
- Pitch: Prepare a 1-minute demo to show off the work.
